Dear All,

As all of you already know that today is my last day in office, so before I leave I wish to bid goodbye to all. It is a very emotional moment to me because all of you have been great colleagues to me and more importantly, I can proudly say that I have also found friends in you.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for the immense support and cooperation that you all provided during my time here. I will always remember our team work especially in the WSS and Survitec projects. Your support and our team bonding was a source of strength. In a lot of different ways, I have experienced your kindness, and so today, please let me extend my heartfelt gratitude to all of you. The guidance I received from you, the encouragement and comfort and above all, the friendship, helped me stay strong all these years. Just as the feeling of embarking on a new life is exciting, leaving all of you is equally disheartening. It is a weak moment for me and in this moment, I would like to say, thank you all for everything that you gave me.

I wish all of you a very best of times and hope that you will have a bright and growing future.
